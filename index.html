<h1>Review of "The Force Awakens"</h1>
<img src="starwars.jpg"/>
<p>Okay, I lied. I haven't seen the movie yet. In fact, I have very little interest in the movie or in Star Wars itself. But, I have done some research relating to the movie that you might find interesting as a Star Wars fan.</p>
<h1>The Reviews</h1>
<h2>Rotten Tomatoes</h2>
<p>Rotten Tomatoes gave it excellent reviews. In fact, it gave it a 93% which is an A! The average rating was an 8.2/10. It even got better reviews than The Revenant and that was a very good movie.</p>
<h2>Rolling Stone</h2>
<p>Rolling Stone gave this movie 3.5/4 stars! That's incredible! Maybe I should take you to go see with all of these credible movie review sites giving it such great reviews.</p>
<h2>Roger Ebert</h2>
<p>Roger Ebert also gave this movie 3.5/4 stars. Okay, I'm sold. I'll take you to go see it. It sounds like a classic I can't afford to miss out on. The question is, when should we go?</p>
<h2>When should we see it?</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Tomorrow</li>
  <li>The day after</li>
<li>Next week</li>
<li>Next month</li>
<li>Rent it or watch it online</li>
</ol>
